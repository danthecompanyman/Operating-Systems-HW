Operating Systems HW
====================

This repo contains the evolution of my homework in UP's Operating Systems class over the course of the semester.
The goal of this class is to build an entire self-contained simulation of an OS and its underlying hardware by the end of the semester.

The assemply language for this OS is a simplified version of MIPS created specifically for this class called Pidgin Assembly.

Homework 1
----------
Complete just enough code that the simulation can run a simple program.
