Operating Systems HW
====================

This repo contains the evolution of my homework in UP's Operating Systems class over the course of the semester.
The goal of this class is to build an entire self-contained simulation of an OS and its underlying hardware by the end of the semester.

The assembly language for this OS is a simplified version of MIPS created specifically for this class called Pidgin Assembly.

All of this code was done in Eclipse, and I'm using the opportunity to learn and use the GitHub plugin for Eclipse, known as EGit.  Annoyed at it's apparent desire to push up the parent project folder instead of just the contents, but whatever.

Check the list of commits to see each finished homework assignment.

Homework 1
----------
Complete just enough code that the simulation can run a simple program.

Homework 2
----------
Support for systems calls and interrupts should be implemented in SOS.java.
